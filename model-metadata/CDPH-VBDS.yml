  "A bayesian negative binomial regression was fitted to risk factors associated with the transmission of WNV. 
  This refression fitting is similar to the one described in https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9119623/
  but was done on monthly data instead of bi-weekly rolls to forecast three weeks ahead."
