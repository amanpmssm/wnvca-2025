  "Two predictors were trained upon the data. The first one is a binary classifier to detect if any cases are present, 
  and returns the probabilities of P(C=0) and P(c>0). The second model is a regressor that returns the predicted number of cases
  with their corresponding quantile levels. Finally, we evaluate both predictors on each data point and retrieve the full 
  distribution with: P(c>0)*P(Q)."
