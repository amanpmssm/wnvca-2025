This is the data repository for the 2025 CDPH West Nile virus Forecasting Challenge. This is an open (*by request*) forecasting challenge to predict monthly West Nile virus (WNV) total disease cases in select California counties in 2025 in the months of *May* through *December*.


## Forecasts of Reported West Nile Virus Cases in Select Counties in California

* **Regions**:
  * North Sacramento Valley: *Glenn*, *Butte*, *Colusa*, *Sutter*, *Yuba*
  * South Sacramento Valley: *Yolo*, *Sacramento*, *Placer*
  * North San Joaquin: *San Joaquin*, *Stanislaus*, *Merced*
  * South San Joaquin: *Madera*, *Fresno*, *Kings*, *Tulare*, *Kern*
  * Southern California: *San Bernardino*, *Riverside*
  * Greater LA: *Los Angeles*, *Orange*

* **Dates**: The Challenge Period will begin April 2025 and will run until October 2025. Participants are currently asked to submit forecasts by: *April 30th*, *May 31*, *June 30*, *July 31*, *August 31*, *September 30*, and *October 31* (herein referred to as the Forecast Due Dates). All submissions should include forecasts for all remaining months of 2025 (through December).

* **Prediction Targets**: The main target is the `quantile` distribution of cases in each region-month over the whole WNV, with the option for teams to submit the point probability of zero cases on the same spatiotemporal scale. Please refer to our [targets guide](https://github.com/cdphmodeling/wnvca-2025/tree/main/model-output#output_type) for more information.
